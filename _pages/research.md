My research lies at the intersection of *Cognitive Neuroscience, Computational Science, and Psychology*, from low-level perceptual learning to complex decision-making, using Deep Learning models, both from a theoretical perspective and applied to neuroimaging (fMRI, MEG/EEG) and behavioural data.

<br>
Currently, I am investigating semantic navigation strategies in human adults and their neural underpinnings using high-density EEG. Additionally, I am exploring the developmental trajectories of children's abilities to navigate semantic spaces, and how these abilities predict high-level cognitive processes like generalization, inference, exploration-exploitation strategies, and Pavlovian bias.

## Computational Models of CPS
*How do humans efficiently solve the exploration/exploitation trade-off in CPS?* 

In this study, we provide compelling evidence that children balance novelty and appropriateness to generate creative associations by optimally regulating the level of exploration in the semantic search.

A similarity matrix was generated with target words as rows and responses as columns, which was used with a softmax action selection rule to build and fit the semantic explorer model to children's data via a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss function. (B) Results include a scatterplot showing real versus fitted parameters. (C) Bar plots displaying loss values for three models (with error bars for SEM).

## Exploring CPS Brain Dynamics

*How the brain support semantic exploration and creativity in narrative generation?*

This study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying semantic control during narrative creation, employing advanced fMRI techniques alongside cutting-edge deep learning language models. Our findings uncover distinct patterns of brain activity that govern semantic exploration and facilitate the creative process of story generation, offering new insights into the cognitive and neural dynamics that fuel creativity.

## Boosting CPS

This study provides a novel approach to how simulated sensory experiences can enhance decision-making strategies. Exploring these mechanisms deepens our understanding of CPS and highlights promising therapeutic interventions, especially for clinical populations that could benefit from improved cognitive functioning.
