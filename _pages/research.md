My research lies at the intersection of *Psychology, Computational Cognitive Science, and Cognitive Neuroscience*, from low-level perceptual learning to complex decision-making, applying Deep Learning models to neuroimaging (fMRI, MEG/EEG) and behavioural data.

Currently, I am investigating semantic navigation strategies in human adults and their neural underpinnings using high-density EEG. Additionally, I am exploring the developmental trajectories of children's abilities to navigate semantic spaces, and how these abilities predict high-level cognitive processes like generalization, inference, exploration-exploitation strategies, and Pavlovian bias.

## Computational Models of CPS
*How do humans efficiently solve the exploration/exploitation trade-off in CPS?* 

In this study, we provide compelling evidence that children balance novelty and appropriateness to generate creative associations by optimally regulating the level of exploration in the semantic search.

A similarity matrix was generated with target words as rows and responses as columns, which was used with a softmax action selection rule to build and fit the semantic explorer model to children's data via a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss function. (B) Results include a scatterplot showing real versus fitted parameters. (C) Bar plots displaying loss values for three models (with error bars for SEM).

## Exploring CPS Brain Dynamics

*How the brain support semantic exploration and creativity in narrative generation?*

In this study we investigate the neural mechanisms underlying semantic control during narrative creation, employing advanced fMRI techniques alongside cutting-edge large language models. Our findings uncover distinct patterns of brain activity that govern semantic exploration and facilitate the creative process of story generation, offering new insights into the cognitive and neural dynamics that fuel creativity.

## Boosting CPS

*How can we foster CPS in individuals?*

The research explores whether simulated visual hallucinations in virtual reality can enhance cognitive flexibility (CF), an essential component for adapting to changing environments. Using VR videos altered by the DeepDream algorithm to simulate hallucinations, participants showed increased flexibility in their semantic networks and a reduction in automatic responses, suggesting that those experiences may facilitate the exploration of creative, less conventional strategies in problem-solving.
