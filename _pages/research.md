My research lies at the intersection of *Cognitive Neuroscience, Computational Linguistics, and Artificial Intelligence*, focusing on understanding complex cognitive processes, such as **Creative Problem-Solving (CPS)**, using Deep Learning models, both from a theoretical perspective and applied to neuroimaging (fMRI, MEG/EEG) and behavioural data.

Current and past research projects include:

- Computational Models of CPS 
- Exploring CPS Brain Dynamic 
- Boosting CPS skills

## Computational Models of CPS
*How do humans efficiently solve the exploration/exploitation trade-off to generate creative word associations?* 

In this study, we provide compelling evidence that children balance novelty and appropriateness to generate creative associations by optimally regulating the level of exploration in the semantic search.

A similarity matrix was generated with target words as rows and responses as columns, which was used with a softmax action selection rule to build and fit the semantic explorer model to children's data via a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss function. (B) Results include a scatterplot showing real versus fitted parameters. (C) Bar plots displaying loss values for three models (with error bars for SEM). (D) Line plots representing the loss landscape across participants. (E) raincloud plots visualizing beta parameter differences between conditions.

## Exploring CPS Brain Dynamic 

In this recent work, we explore the neural foundations of semantic control in narrative creation, leveraging advanced fMRI techniques and state-of-the-art deep learning language models. These tools reveal unique patterns of brain activity that drive semantic exploration and fuel the creative process of story generation.

## Boosting CPS

This study provides a novel approach to how simulated sensory experiences can enhance decision-making strategies. By exploring these mechanisms, it deepens our understanding of CPS and highlights promising therapeutic interventions, especially for clinical populations that could benefit from improved cognitive functioning.
