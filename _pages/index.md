# About

I am a doctoral candidate in *Cognitive Science* at the **University of Trento** and in *Experimental Medicine* at the **University of Tübingen**, where I work at the [MEG Center](https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/de/medizinische-fakultaet/forschung/core-facilities/meg-zentrum).
<br>     
          My research investigates how *semantic cognition* shapes the exploration of semantic spaces and supports *creative problem-solving (CPS)*. I focus on how these cognitive processes develop and function across the lifespan, both in healthy individuals and those with neurological conditions, utilizing neuroimaging techniques (EEG, MEG, fMRI), computational cognitive modeling, and machine learning approaches, including Large Language Models (LLMs).
