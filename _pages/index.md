# About

I am a doctoral candidate in *Cognitive Science* at the **University of Trento** and in *Experimental Medicine* at the **University of Tübingen**, where I work at the [MEG Center](https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/de/medizinische-fakultaet/forschung/core-facilities/meg-zentrum).

Research Interests
======

I am interested in exploring high-level cognitive processes such as semantic decision-making and creative problem-solving across the lifespan in both health and disease, using behavioral, neuroimaging, and computational modeling.
