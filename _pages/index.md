# About

I am a doctoral candidate in *Cognitive Science* at the **University of Trento** and in *Experimental Medicine* at the **University of Tübingen**, where I work at the [MEG Center](https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/de/medizinische-fakultaet/forschung/core-facilities/meg-zentrum).
<br>     
           My work focuses on the role of semantic cognition in shaping the exploration of semantic spaces and in creative problem-solving. I am interested in how these cognitive processes develop and function across the lifespan, both in health and disease using neuroimaging (EEG, MEG, fMRI), computational cognitive modeling and machine learning models, including Large Language Models (LLMs).
